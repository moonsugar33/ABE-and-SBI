# Advanced Badge Editor + Simple Badge Injector 
# (1.3.1 + 1.2)
An advanced 3DS Badge Editor for PC and its companion app for 3DS

## Fork
Advanced Badge Editor (PC) works in tandem with Simple Badge Injector (3DS).

This fork bundles TurdPooCharger's latest fork of Simple Badge Injector (3DS), which is launchable from the Home menu.

Drop the .CIA in your CIA folder, and the SimpleBadgeInjector folder into the "3ds" folder (located on the root of your SD card). 

If you aren't already, follow the guide here:

It may help you to use FTP to move the files across:

## Features
This app lets you edit your BadgeData.dat and BadgeMngFile.dat files with ease!
Make sure that both files are in the same directory when openning them with the editor.

It also lets you create badge data, but you will need to know your NNID number if you want to use the badges.

Create your own badges and sets easily, by clicking a button and importing a PNG image!
You can also import badge data from *.prb files and set data from *.cab files.
